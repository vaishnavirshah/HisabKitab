# HisabKitab
#### *AatmaNirbhar Vyapari bane*

HisabKitab is a simple GST Billing and Stock Management software for local vendors and shopkeepers to keep a track of their previous transactions and printing bills at the same time. They can access this either through their phones downloading the app or using the website, making the software available for all categories of vendors.

## The problem Hisaab-kitaab solves
The current market base suggests medium to large scale vendors are using such tech to generate bills and maintain records but smaller vendors are maintaining handwritten accounts. Such difference in methods of billing can be modified if they are using the same application.
But this solution will be further discarded on terms of availability and affordability of devices to use such applications. And for this very reason we have proposed the use of website and application which can be used as per convenience, the use of both from time to time is also possible


## Challenges we ran into
Various problems and error were faced while making the product.Since the problem statement specified that this software should be useful for both so we decided that we should make an android app for the local vendors and web app for small scale business. The job of making it easily accessible to both customer base was something we really had to think about.
We decided to go with both web and app application but following this we were faced with even more problems such as having the same synchronized database for both. The use of firebase with express app was something we were not familiar with and using the same data structure for both was something we had to carefully monitor.
Firebase authentication was also one step where we got stuck followed by generation of the invoice as pdf.


## Technologies we used
- Firebase
- JavaScript
- Dart
- Flutter
- HTML/CSS
- Nodejs
- Express
